# Unique Device Id Provider

> It's quite complex to have a way to get an unique identifier on android that's compatible with all android versions as you can see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2785485/is-there-a-unique-android-device-id) 

### Keep in mind

> This approach doesn't need any android permissions

> if you wipe the app data it will generate a new unique ID

## Usage

```kotlin

// create it or provide it with a DI framework
val idProvider = UniqueDeviceIdProvider(context) 

// retrieve the unique key
idProvider.getUniqueId() // ca705d9b-0598-4f75-b71a-973934160055
```
